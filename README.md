# HR-Analytics

## Introduction

This system comprises several modules designed to streamline HR processes and improve both candidate and employee experiences.

### Recruitment Module
Applicants can submit cover letters and resumes, which are parsed using sophisticated algorithms to extract key information. Cover letters are assessed for cultural fit, with scores displayed on an HR dashboard to aid in candidate review and decision-making.

### Employee Promotion Module
A machine learning model predicts employees' eligibility for promotion based on organizational requirements and performance metrics. The system generates a list of qualified employees for managers and HR staff to review.

### Sentiment Analysis
Using NLP methods, the system analyzes sentiment from biannual employee surveys. Results are organized by department and accessible to HR staff, providing insights into employee engagement, satisfaction, and concerns. These insights help HR make informed decisions to enhance employee experience and retention.

### Rule-Based Chatbot
Integrated into the candidate dashboard, the chatbot provides information about the work environment, values, and culture of the organization. It serves as an interactive tool to help candidates understand the company better and improve their overall experience.
